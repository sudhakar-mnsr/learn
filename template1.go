// Create a program that declares two anonymous functions. One that counts down from
// 100 to 0 and one that counts up from 0 to 100. Display each number with an
// unique identifier for each goroutine. Then create goroutines from these functions
// and don't let main return until the goroutines complete.
//
// Run the program in parallel.
