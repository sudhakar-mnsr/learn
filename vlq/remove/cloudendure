Cloud migration does not need to be a complex, time consuming, or costly endeavor. CloudEndure Migration simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of cloud migration by offering a highly automated lift-and-shift solution.

Enterprises looking to quickly rehost a large number of machines to AWS can use CloudEndure Migration without worrying about compatibility, performance disruption, or long cutover windows. Any re-architecture that needs to be done can be performed more easily after your machines are running on AWS.

CloudEndure Migration continually replicates your source machines into a staging area in your AWS account without causing downtime or impacting performance. When you’re ready to launch the production machines, CloudEndure Migration automatically converts your machines from their source infrastructure into the AWS infrastructure so they can boot and run natively in AWS.

With CloudEndure Migration, an agent-based solution, you can migrate all applications and databases that run on supported versions of Windows and Linux OS. This includes Windows Server versions 2003/2008/2012/2016/2019 and Linux distributions, such as CentOS, RHEL, OEL, SUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian. CloudEndure Migration supports common databases, including Oracle and SQL Server, as well as enterprise applications such as SAP.

CloudEndure provides simplified, cost effective, highly automated lift-and-shift migration solution. CloudEndure is agent-based solution which need to be installed on source machines. It can be configured very easily using CloudEndure console (detailed info on settings in references below). CloudEndure once configured starts to replicate into configured target AWS region (staging area). CloudEndure automatically chooses low cost instances and low cost EBS volumes. CloudEndure uses single replicator for 15 source disks. The CloudEndure replication setup during migration is as shown.

Most advantageous part with CloudEndure is its blueprint launches with different configurations. These different configurations can be tested and when we are satisfied with test results cutover can be triggered. When cutover is done all the test servers are automatically deleted. This process is depicted in below diagram

CloudEndure can be used to migrate all applications and databases running on Windows and Linux operating systems. 

CloudEndure has 90 day free trail for migration, if in anycase migration is not completed we can create another account and do the migration. So the entire migration can be completed with free CloudEndure Licenses.

Continuous Replication
CloudEndure Disaster Recovery continually replicates any changes you make to your source machines into the staging area. This enables sub-second Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs). During a disaster or drill, click a button in the CloudEndure User Console to launch fully operational workloads according to your predefined networking and machine properties.
Orchestration and Machine Conversion
CloudEndure Disaster Recovery performs automated orchestration and machine conversion so that your source machines will boot and run natively on AWS. These automated processes are executed on all launched machines in parallel and within minutes, irrespective of machine size or storage usage. This enables Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) of minutes.
Failover
If disaster strikes, click a button in the CloudEndure Console to launch an automated failover. CloudEndure Disaster Recovery will spin up the most up-to-date version of your machines. For cases of data corruptions, accidental system changes, or ransomware, you can instruct CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to spin up your source machines at previous consistent points in time by selecting your preferred time in the CloudEndure Console.
Failback
Once a disaster is over, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery uses automated machine conversion and orchestration technology to perform a rapid failback of up-to-date workloads into your source environment. Replication of the data back to your source environment occurs without disrupting normal business operations.
